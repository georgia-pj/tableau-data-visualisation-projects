# 📊 Data Visualization Portfolio (Tableau)

Welcome to my **Data Visualization Portfolio**, a collection of interactive dashboards and visual storytelling projects created using **Tableau**. These projects reflect my skills in **data analysis**, **design thinking**, and **communicating insights effectively through visual mediums**.

Each project in this repository is housed in its own folder, complete with a Tableau workbook (`.twbx`), a `README.md` explaining the project, and static dashboard images for preview.
